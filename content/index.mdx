# Why I Made This Website
1. Are you scared of saying "the wrong thing" when it comes to talking about racism?
2. Do you fell like you're just now realizing that racism is still a thing in 2020?
3. Do you feel overwhelmed and don't know where to start?
3. Do you want to love your neighbor as yourself?
4. Have you been looking for a place to get resources related to race and racism in America? 
5. Do you want to do something about it? 

My name is Brent Ingram, I'm a follower of Jesus, Husband, Father, Pastor at Rest LA, Website Developer, and IT Engineer.

And I'm unapologetically Black.

This website is for you.

This website exists because God created all human beings in His image and have inherent value and dignity. (Theologians call this Imago Dei). Whenever an injustice is done against another human being it is an act of devaluing what God says is good.
In the United States one of the longest lasting acts of injustice has been towards Black and Brown people, simply because of the color of their skin, or their ethnic background. This is evil.

Jesus has called his followers to be Salt and Light. Like salt we need to actively prevent evil and its dehumanizing decay of injustice. And as light we need to proactively spread the ideals and qualities of Jesus' kingdom here on earth.
A lot of churches in the U.S. have focused on being the light with evangelism, but have forsaken being salt in multiple arenas.

More people are realizing that racism is still an active dehumanizing decay of injustice. This is a good thing. However it can be emotionally draining when all of these new people start asking their Black and Brown friends and acquaintances what to do.
Many minorities have gladly shared their stories with how racism has affected them and their families. A lot of us love to teach, but we don't have enough time to teach everyone. We're human and have limits.

If you are fairly new to this conversation and need to catch up this website is a compilation of resources to help you learn more and do some homework on your own. It is here to help take you deeper so that you can be more empathetic and understanding in this conversation and so that you can take an informed stand against racism.

These resources are meant to educate, not indoctrinate. The authors and resources don't agree on every single issue and that is okay. You might not agree with everything said by everyone here. That is okay. Take the time to examine WHY you don't agree.

There will be people who are outside of your theological "bubble".
That is okay. All truth is God's truth. If you find that something is true run with it. I want people to think critically, pray and ask the Holy Spirit what they should do with this information.

I believe that God is 100% against racism and systems of oppression. He is a God of Justice and Mercy. As followers of Jesus we should follow his lead.

If you've made it this far, **good job!** I know that was a wall of text. This is going to be a marathon not a sprint. 

Keep pressing forward, one step at a time, and don't forget to pray!


# So Where Do I Start?
The eradication of racism moves at the speed of relationships. It starts with doing your homework. 
There are a lot of resources here to help you get caught up and to go deeper in understanding race and racism in the U.S.

1. I recommend learning the backstory of racism and how it affects people today. 

 A great, short comprehensive video to get you started is below.

2. Take action, so you're not just filled with information. 

3. Engage with your community and your spheres of influence. 

4. Last, but not least support and hire consultants that are dedicating their lives to this work.
